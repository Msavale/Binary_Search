Welcome to the Binary Search repository! This repository contains algorithms, code samples, and documentation related to the binary search algorithm.

Introduction
Binary search is a fundamental searching algorithm used to locate a target value within a sorted array or list efficiently. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the target value is found or the interval is empty.

How Binary Search Works
Binary search operates on the principle of divide and conquer. Here's a high-level overview of how it works:

Initialize: Start with the entire sorted array as the search interval.
Divide: Compute the middle index of the current interval.
Compare: Compare the target value with the middle element of the array.
If the target value matches the middle element, the search is complete, and its index is returned.
If the target value is less than the middle element, continue searching in the left half of the array.
If the target value is greater than the middle element, continue searching in the right half of the array.
Repeat: Repeat steps 2-3 until the target value is found or the search interval is empty.
